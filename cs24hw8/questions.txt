Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
If its permission is NONE, then trying to access it will throw a SEGV_ACCERR, 
which we can catch in the handler. Then if we check the permission in the
handler for such an error and its NONE, we know a page is being accessed,
so we can detect it that way.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
We check the permission when a SEGV_ACCERR is thrown and handled. If the perm
is READ, then we know that something is writing to it, which means it'll become
dirt; we can detect dirty pages this way.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:
Total page loads:  52890

g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  FIFO

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> make clean && make && ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  47944
47
If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  CLRU

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> make clean && make all && ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  69823

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please

what the assignment says about the policy here.


I also tried aging since my CLRU didn't work... but it also didn't work...
>> make clean && make && ./test_matrix_aging -m 1024 1000
