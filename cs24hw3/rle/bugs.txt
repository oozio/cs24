Bugs in rl_decode() function:
-----------------------------

1) Push/pop: We need to push rdx, rcx, and rsi 
in addition to rbx and rdi, since we want to
recover these values after calling malloc, 
which overwrites them.

2) Integer size limitations: In find_space_loop,
we add the content of rdi[i] into %bl, which can
hold only 8 bits, up to a maximum of decimal value
255. For this file to work with larger inputs, 
we need to use a different, larger counter; then
we need to keep only the lower eight bits of this
counter, incrementing the final tally in ebx by
the same amount.

3) Increment error: In line 41 of the original, to
increment a counter, rcx was incremented by 1;
however, we need to increment by 2, since we want 
to look at every other char, which takes up 1 
space each.

4) Increment output counter: In write_loop, the
output counter r10 never gets incremented, so to
avoid writing the same thing over and over again,
we add a line that adds 1 to the value in r10.
