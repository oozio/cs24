Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under First-Fit but not Best-Fit
===============================================================================
Suppose we start out with a 16 KB heap:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |                                                               |
  |                                                               |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

We allocate using first fit an 8 KB block (A), a 4 KB block (B), and then a
4 KB block (C).

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A                              |B              |C              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

Then we free the 8 KB block (A), and the second 4 KB block (C), 
leaving 2 non-coalesced free blocks. 

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |_                              |B              |_              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

We allocate using first fit another 4 KB block called A:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A              |_              |B              |_              |
  |4              |4              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

We try to allocate 8 bits into a block called C, but since the largest
remaining blocks are at most 4 KBs long, we would fail.

If we'd used best fit to allocate the second set, however, we would've had:

We allocate using best fit 4 KB block called A: 
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |_                              |B              |A              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ,

  after which we can allocate another 8 KBs from the first free block.
