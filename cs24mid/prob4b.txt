Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under Best-Fit but not First-Fit
===============================================================================

Suppose we start out with a 16 KB heap:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |                                                               |
  |                                                               |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

We allocate using best fit an 8 KB block, a 4 KB block, and then a 4 KB 
block.

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A                              |B              |C              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

Then we free the 8 KB block (A), and the second 4 KB block (C), 
leaving 2 non-coalesced free blocks. 
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |_                              |B              |_              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

We allocate using best fit 2 KBs to C, then 3 KBs to A:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A          |_                  |B              |C      |_      |
  |3          |5                  |4              |2      |2      |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ,

Then we allocate 4 KB to D, and free B:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A          |D              |_  |_              |C      |_      |
  |3          |4              |1  |4              |2      |2      |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ,

Then we allocate 3 KB to B:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |A          |D              |_  |B          |_  |C      |_      |
  |3          |4              |1  |3          |1  |2      |2      |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ,

Then we can try to allocate 3 more KB to E, but we'll fail, since the largest
remaining blocks are at most 2 KB.

However, if we had used first fit for the second set of allocations, 
we would've had:

Starting with
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |_                              |B              |_              |
  |8                              |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

We allocate using first fit 2 KBs to C, then 3 KBs to A:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |C      |A          |_          |B              |_              |
  |2      |3          |3          |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ ,

Then we allocate 4 KB to D, and free B, in that order:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |C      |A          |_          |_              |D              |
  |2      |4          |3          |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

Then we allocate 3 KB to B:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |C      |A          |B          |_              |D              |
  |2      |4          |3          |4              |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

Then we still have room to allocate 3 KB to E:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |C      |A          |B          |E          |_  |D              |
  |2      |4          |3          |3          |1  |4              |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
