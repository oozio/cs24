a. 
	3GHz processor
	cache has 1 cycle of access latency
	main has 100 cycles of latency
	1 datum per instruction

	Each second, we try to run 3G instructions. If we had a miss rate of 0, 
	we would complete all 3G, since each hit takes 1 cycle. Since we're only
	completing 750M, this means that we're using up 
	(750M * 1 cycle) + (n * 100 cycles) = 3G cycles, where n is the number of 
	misses. Then (n * 100) = 2.25 billion; n = 22.5 * 10 ^ 7. Then the miss
	rate is n / (instructions attempted) = n / (22.5 * 10 ^ 7 + 750 M) = 2.91%. 

b. If we want to double the number of completed instructions per second, we 
	have to satisfy the equation
	(750M * 2 * 1 cycle) + (n * 100 cycles) = 3G cycles, where n is the number
	of misses. Then (n * 100) = 1.5 billion ; n = 15 million. The miss rate 
	is n / (15 million + 750M) = 1.96%, which is a reduction of ~0.95%.
